# ELEC576
Authors: Dongwook Kim, Fuad Hasan

Overview

- This repository contains the final project for ELEC 576, focusing on flood extent mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
We tried to train multiple deep learning models on one of the publicly available large-scale Sentinel-1 datasets and evaluated their generalization capability using Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery.
